## What Gets Scanned

The plugin checks these sources to determine which media files are "in use":

- **Post & page content** -- all post types, Gutenberg blocks, classic editor
- **Featured images** -- all post types including custom post types
- **Custom fields (postmeta)** -- any plugin/theme that stores attachment IDs or URLs
- **ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)** -- image, file, gallery, repeater, flexible content, group, clone fields, and Options pages
- **WooCommerce** -- product galleries, variation images
- **Elementor** -- page builder widget data (`_elementor_data`)
- **Theme files** -- PHP, CSS, JS files scanned for hardcoded `/wp-content/uploads/` references
- **CSS background images** -- inline `background-image` styles in post content
- **Widgets** -- image, gallery, text, custom HTML widgets
- **Site identity** -- site logo, site icon, custom header, background image
- **Serialized data** -- deep scan of complex plugin data structures in postmeta

## Usage Guide

### Running a Scan

1. Navigate to **Media > Oli Media Cleaner** in your WordPress admin
2. Click the **Scan for Unused Media** button
3. A progress bar will show real-time scanning progress
4. Once complete, the results appear in the **Unused** tab

The scan processes attachments in batches of 50 to prevent server timeouts. The last scan date is displayed next to the scan button.

### Managing Results

The plugin provides three tabs:

#### Unused Tab
Shows all media files not found in any scanned source.

- **View** -- opens the file in a new tab
- **Edit** -- opens the WordPress media editor
- **Whitelist** -- protects the file from future scans
- **Trash** -- moves the file to WordPress trash

#### Whitelist Tab
Shows protected files that will never be flagged as unused.

- **View** -- opens the file
- **Remove** -- removes from whitelist (will appear as unused on next scan)

#### Trash Tab
Shows trashed media files.

- **Restore** -- moves the file back out of trash
- **Delete** -- permanently deletes the file and all its thumbnails from disk

### Bulk Actions

Select multiple files using checkboxes, then use the bulk action buttons:

- **Select All** -- toggles all checkboxes on the current page
- **Trash Selected** / **Whitelist Selected** -- on the Unused tab
- **Remove from Whitelist** -- on the Whitelist tab
- **Restore Selected** / **Delete Permanently** -- on the Trash tab

### Search, Sort & Filter

#### Search
Type in the search box and press Enter or click **Search**. Searches by:
- File name/title
- Filename (URL)
- File extension
- Attachment ID

Clear the search box to reset.

#### Sort
Click any column header to sort:
- **Name** -- alphabetical (A-Z / Z-A)
- **Size** -- smallest/largest first
- **Type** -- by file extension
- **Date** -- newest/oldest first (default: newest first)

The active sort column shows an arrow indicator.

#### Filter by Type
Use the dropdown to filter by file type. Types are grouped into categories:
- **Images** -- JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, etc.
- **Documents** -- PDF, DOC, XLSX, CSV, etc.
- **Video** -- MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM
- **Audio** -- MP3, WAV, OGG

Only file types found in your scan results appear in the dropdown.

#### Per-Page
Below the results table, choose to display **20**, **50**, or **100** items per page.

### Trash All Unused

For sites with thousands of unused files:

1. Click the red **Trash All Unused** button
2. Confirm the action in the dialog
3. The plugin processes files in batches of 50
4. A progress bar shows real-time progress (e.g., "45% -- 4,500 / 10,192 trashed")
5. Whitelisted files are never trashed

### Scheduled Auto-Cleanup

Automate the scan and trash process:

1. Scroll down to the **Scheduled Auto-Cleanup** section
2. Check **Enable Auto-Cleanup**
3. Choose a frequency: **Daily**, **Twice Daily**, or **Weekly**
4. Click **Save Settings**

The next scheduled run time is displayed. The cron job:
- Runs a full scan (same as manual scan)
- Automatically trashes all unused files
- Respects whitelisted files
- Updates scan results and date

The schedule is cleared on plugin deactivation.

## FAQ

### Is it safe to delete unused media?

The plugin moves files to WordPress trash first. You can review and restore before permanently deleting. **Always make a full backup before bulk deletion.**

### Does it work with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)?

Yes. Uses the ACF API to discover all field groups and recursively scans image, file, gallery, repeater, flexible content, group, and clone fields -- including ACF Options pages.

### Does it work with WooCommerce?

Yes. Product featured images, gallery images, and variation images are all detected as "in use."

### Does it work with Elementor?

Yes. Scans Elementor's `_elementor_data` post meta for image and media references.

### Does it scan theme files?

Yes. All PHP, CSS, and JS files in the active theme (and parent theme) are scanned for hardcoded references to `wp-content/uploads/`.

### Can I whitelist images?

Yes. Whitelist individual images or bulk select multiple. Whitelisted images are never flagged as unused and are skipped during auto-cleanup.

### Does it create custom database tables?

No. The plugin uses WordPress options only. Lightweight and clean.

### Will it slow down my site?

No. The plugin only loads its assets on the plugin's admin page. Nothing runs on the frontend.

### What happens when I uninstall?

All plugin options and cron schedules are removed. Your media files are not affected.
